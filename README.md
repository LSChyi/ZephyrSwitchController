# Zephyr Nintendo Switch Controller

A joystick controller runs on [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) RTOS, and
is controllable via a serial port.

This is a proof of concept fun project, and all the USB configurations comes
from
[Kashalls/NintendoSwitchController](https://github.com/Kashalls/NintendoSwitchController).

The required  Zephyr SDK is version 3.0.0.
